                             ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QTask Manager is a fully functional task management web application built using 
vanilla JavaScript. It demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals 
like DOM manipulation, object-oriented programming (OOP), event handling, and 
client-side data persistence.

The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks 
with support for categories (Personal, Work, Urgent, Education, Health) and 
priority levels (Low, Medium, High). It features real-time task filtering, 
searching, and visual status indicators.


                             MAIN FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✓ Add, edit, delete, and list tasks.  
✓ Categorize tasks with emoji-based labels.  
✓ Filter tasks by category or completion status.  
✓ Set and highlight task priority.  
✓ Notification system for high-priority tasks.  
✓ Responsive design for mobile and desktop.  
✓ Search tasks by title or description.  
✓ Mark tasks as completed with visual strike-through. 
✓ Dark/light theme toggle with saved preference.
✓ Input validation and confirmation modals.  


                             WHAT I LEARNED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Through this assignment, I strengthened my skills in vanilla JavaScript, 
particularly OOP concepts using classes such as Task, TaskManager, modular code 
organization, and dynamic UI updates using event-driven architecture. I gained 
hands-on experience with real-time filtering, responsive web design, and 
localStorage for data persistence.

Additionally, I explored ways to improve user experience through features like 
notifications, theme toggles, search, and animations. This project taught me 
how to approach building scalable and user-friendly applications without 
external libraries or frameworks.
